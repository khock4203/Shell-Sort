Sorts a series of numbers using the Shell sorting system, invented by an alum of my college. Responds with the time it took to sort (In seconds) and the sorted list.
Change the values in the "Test1" text file to sort diffrent numbers.

Runs on JDK 1.8. To run, compile and run MyShellSort.java in the command prompt.
